# Hybrid Geolocation Security Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a cost-effective, multi-layered security system that restricts users to their registered country without expensive SMS verification. It uses a hybrid approach combining phone number detection, IP geolocation, and browser location (Phase 2).

## Phase 1 Features (Implemented)

### 1. Phone Number Country Detection
- Automatically detects country from phone number during signup
- No manual country selection allowed
- Validates phone number format per country

### 2. IP Geolocation Verification
- Verifies user's IP location matches registered country
- Works at signup, login, and during active sessions
- Uses free geolocation APIs (no cost)

### 3. Risk Scoring System
- Calculates risk score (0-100) based on multiple factors:
  - VPN/Proxy detection: +30 points
  - Country mismatch: +40 points
  - Neighboring country: -10 points
  - Suspicious IP patterns: +20 points

### 4. Automated Actions Based on Risk
- **0-30**: Allow access normally
- **31-60**: Allow with increased monitoring
- **61-80**: Require additional verification (Phase 2)
- **81-100**: Block access immediately

### 5. Comprehensive Logging
- All location verifications logged
- Blocked access attempts tracked
- Session locations monitored
- Admin dashboard for suspicious activity

## Security Measures

### At Signup:
1. Country detected from phone number
2. IP location verified to match
3. High-risk signups blocked (VPN, wrong country)
4. Medium-risk signups flagged for monitoring

### At Login:
1. IP location checked against registered country
2. Risk score calculated
3. High-risk logins blocked with clear message
4. Session tracking initiated

### During Sessions:
1. Periodic location checks via middleware
2. Automatic logout for high-risk changes
3. All location changes logged
4. Real-time risk assessment

## Database Tables Created

### 1. `location_verification_logs`
- Tracks all verification attempts
- Stores risk scores and flags
- Used for pattern analysis

### 2. `blocked_access_attempts`
- Records all blocked access
- Includes reason and risk factors
- For security monitoring

### 3. `user_session_locations`
- Tracks active session locations
- Monitors for location changes
- Enables pattern detection

### 4. `risk_scoring_config`
- Configurable risk thresholds
- Adjustable scoring factors
- Admin-controlled settings

## How It Prevents Cross-Country Access

### 1. **No Manual Country Selection**
- Country automatically detected from phone
- Cannot be changed after registration
- Database trigger prevents updates

### 2. **Multi-Point Verification**
- Phone number must match IP location
- Continuous verification during use
- Immediate blocking of mismatches

### 3. **VPN/Proxy Detection**
- Common VPN IP ranges detected
- Datacenter IPs flagged
- High risk score for proxy use

### 4. **Session Monitoring**
- Location tracked per session
- Sudden country changes blocked
- Pattern analysis for fraud detection

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Scripts

```bash
# Run in order:
1. scripts/country_restrictions_setup.sql
2. scripts/location_verification_tables.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables

No additional environment variables needed - uses free geolocation services.

### 3. Test the System

#### Test Signup:
1. Try with Nigerian phone number from Nigeria ✓
2. Try with Nigerian phone number from Kenya ✗
3. Try with VPN enabled ✗

#### Test Login:
1. Login from registered country ✓
2. Login from different country ✗
3. Login with VPN ✗

## Monitoring & Admin Tools

### View Suspicious Activity:
```sql
SELECT * FROM suspicious_activity_summary;
```

### Check Blocked Attempts:
```sql
SELECT 
    email,
    ip_address,
    detected_country_code,
    registered_country_code,
    block_reason,
    created_at
FROM blocked_access_attempts
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Monitor High-Risk Users:
```sql
SELECT 
    p.email,
    COUNT(*) as verification_attempts,
    AVG(lvl.risk_score) as avg_risk_score,
    MAX(lvl.risk_score) as max_risk_score
FROM location_verification_logs lvl
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = lvl.user_id
WHERE lvl.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY p.id, p.email
HAVING AVG(lvl.risk_score) > 50
ORDER BY avg_risk_score DESC;
```

## Phase 2 Features (Prepared)

### Browser Geolocation
- Component ready: `components/location/browser-geolocation.tsx`
- GPS/WiFi based verification
- More accurate than IP
- Harder to spoof

### Implementation Plan:
1. Add browser location request after medium-risk login
2. Compare browser location with country boundaries
3. Combine IP + browser for hybrid verification
4. Reduce false positives near borders

## Cost Analysis

### Current Implementation (Phase 1):
- **IP Geolocation**: FREE (1000+ requests/month)
- **Phone Detection**: FREE (built-in)
- **Database Logging**: Minimal Supabase storage

### Compared to SMS:
- SMS: $0.01-0.05 per verification
- 1000 users × 2 verifications/month = $20-100/month
- Our solution: $0/month

## Security Effectiveness

### What It Prevents:
- ✅ Users signing up with foreign phone numbers
- ✅ VPN/Proxy access to cross-country data
- ✅ Account sharing across countries
- ✅ Unauthorized country switching
- ✅ Most casual bypass attempts

### Limitations:
- ⚠️ Sophisticated VPNs might not be detected
- ⚠️ Users at country borders may have issues
- ⚠️ Borrowed phones during signup
- ⚠️ Virtual phone numbers (partially mitigated)

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Monitor for suspicious patterns
2. Require ID verification for high-value lenders
3. Implement browser geolocation (Phase 2)
4. Add behavioral analysis over time

## User Experience

### Clear Messaging:
- "Location verification failed" → Explains why
- "Disable VPN/proxy" → Clear action required
- "Access from registered country" → Sets expectation

### Minimal Friction:
- Automatic detection (no manual steps)
- Instant verification
- Clear error messages
- Works on all devices

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Monitor logs for false positives
2. Adjust risk scoring thresholds
3. Train support on common issues

### Phase 2 (When Ready):
1. Enable browser geolocation for medium-risk
2. Implement 2FA for high-value accounts
3. Add machine learning for pattern detection
4. Consider ID verification for lenders

### Long Term:
1. Behavioral biometrics
2. Device fingerprinting
3. Network analysis
4. AI-powered fraud detection

## Conclusion

This hybrid approach provides strong security without SMS costs. It effectively restricts users to their country while maintaining good UX. The system is:

- **Cost-effective**: $0/month vs $20-100 for SMS
- **Secure**: Multiple verification layers
- **Scalable**: No per-user costs
- **User-friendly**: Automatic and transparent
- **Flexible**: Easy to adjust and enhance

The implementation successfully prevents cross-country data access while keeping costs minimal for your startup.
